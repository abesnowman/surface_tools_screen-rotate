# Surface Tools - screen-rotate

Shamelessly stolen from a comment made by mbinnun on mildmojo's "rotate-desktop.sh" gist at https://gist.github.com/mildmojo/48e9025070a2ba40795c#gistcomment-2694429

Automatically rotates all detected input devices along with the screen.

Dependencies: requires xinput. (apt install xinput / yum install xinput / dnf install xinput / emerge xinput / xbps xinput)
